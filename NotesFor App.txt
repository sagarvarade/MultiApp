Multi app ideas:
1. zero tolerance.
   1. One microservice can not call to other ms, they must have share they are valid and and authorised for communication.
	  Each request will consist of user token and it will be authorised by Authentication application ,
	  If auth app says yes this is valid user then ms2 will share one token with caller, and caller will save for future communiction
	  From the next request ms1 will send that token with user token to the ms2 , ms2 reverify from its data yes this is valid
	  This will save round trip to auth server.
	  each ms will share those tokens in there database,each will have some expiry time.
	  On expiray each ms has to reverify with auth server.
2. All the communiction will be happend by Rsocket only and some request may need https
3. Some request may need HTTPS2
4. While sharing data in between two microservices , we are sharing payload as byte stream in json format , org.json Object
5. If 4th point not used ,then we may not be able to leaverge hibernate application 
6. Make it possible to run some crud queries on application start up.

Hope find some time to implement this.
